# Big Data Project: A Big Data Framework Using Machine Learning Algorithm for Cybersecurity Salary Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting cybersecurity salaries using Big Data technologies, specifically Apache Spark for machine learning tasks. The dataset was primarily collected from Kaggle, and the project explores the application of Random Forest and Linear Regression models for salary prediction. Additionally, Hadoop and HDFS were utilized to handle large-scale data processing.

## Technologies Used
Apache Spark: Employed for scalable and distributed machine learning tasks.
Hadoop and HDFS: Used for distributed storage and processing of large datasets.
Flask: Implemented a simple user interface using Flask in app.py.
Dataset
The dataset for this project was collected from Kaggle, and it revolves around cybersecurity salary prediction. It encompasses a variety of features relevant to cybersecurity roles, and the target is the prediction of salaries.

## Models
Two machine learning models were employed for evaluation:

### Random Forest: A powerful ensemble learning algorithm for regression tasks.
### Linear Regression: Applied for linear modeling and interpretability.
## User Interface
A basic user interface was implemented using Flask in app.py. This allows users to interact with the predictive models and obtain salary predictions based on provided input.

## Usage
1. Ensure Apache Spark, Hadoop, and Flask are installed.
2. Run the Flask app using python app.py.
3. Access the UI to input values and receive salary predictions.

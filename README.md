# Big Data Project: A Big Data Framework Using Machine Learning Algorithm for Cybersecurity Salary Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting cybersecurity salaries using Big Data technologies, specifically Apache Spark for machine learning tasks. The dataset was primarily collected from Kaggle, and the project explores the application of Random Forest and Linear Regression models for salary prediction. Additionally, Hadoop and HDFS were utilized to handle large-scale data processing.

## Technologies Used
1. Apache Spark: Employed for scalable and distributed machine learning tasks.
2. Hadoop and HDFS: Used for distributed storage and processing of large datasets.
3. Flask: Implemented a simple user interface using Flask in app.py.
4. Python Libraries: Utilized various Python libraries, including Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and PySpark.

## Dataset
The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, focuses on cybersecurity salary prediction. It contains information related to job roles, experience levels, employment types, and other features, with the target variable being salary.

## Models
Two machine learning models were employed for evaluation:

### Random Forest: A powerful ensemble learning algorithm for regression tasks.
### Linear Regression: Applied for linear modeling and interpretability.
## User Interface
A basic user interface was implemented using Flask in app.py. This allows users to interact with the predictive models and obtain salary predictions based on provided input.

## Usage
1. Ensure Apache Spark, Hadoop, and Flask are installed.
2. Run the Flask app using python app.py.
3. Access the UI to input values and receive salary predictions.

## Features
1. Data Exploration: Explored the dataset's structure, identified missing values, and performed statistical and aggregation operations.
2. Data Preprocessing: Handled duplicate records, encoded categorical variables, and visualized correlations.
3. Model Training: Trained Random Forest and Linear Regression models for salary prediction.
4. Model Evaluation: Assessed model performance using metrics like RMSE and MSE.
5. User Interface: Implemented a simple Flask app (app.py) for user interaction with the trained models.

## Conclusions
The project successfully demonstrates the application of Apache Spark for big data machine learning tasks, showcasing two different regression models for cybersecurity salary prediction. The user interface allows for easy interaction and exploration of the trained models.
